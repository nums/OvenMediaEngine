For live streaming of certain events, it may be necessary to immediately stop the HLS live stream and switch to VoD after the HLS live broadcast ends. This API transitions to VoD by stopping segment updates for LL-HLS and HLS streams and inserting #EXT-X-ENDLIST. By using this API with a [Scheduled Channel](../../../../../live-source/scheduled-channel.md), you can implement additional application services.
