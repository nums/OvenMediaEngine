## What is OvenMediaEngine?

[**OvenMediaEngine**](https://github.com/OvenMediaLabs/OvenMediaEngine) (OME) is a **Sub**-**Second Latency Live Streaming Server** with **Large**-**Scale** and **High**-**Definition**. With OME, you can create platforms/services/systems that transmit high-definition video to hundreds-thousand viewers with sub-second latency and be scalable, depending on the number of concurrent viewers.

OvenMediaEngine can receive a video/audio, video, or audio source from encoders and cameras such as [OvenLiveKit](https://www.ovenmediaengine.com/olk), OBS, XSplit, and more, to WebRTC, SRT, RTMP, MPEG-2 TS, and RTSP as Input. Then, OME transmits this source using **LLHLS** (Low Latency HLS) and **WebRTC** as output. Also, we provide [OvenPlayer](https://github.com/OvenMediaLabs/OvenPlayer), an Open-Source and JavaScript-based WebRTC/LLHLS Player for OvenMediaEngine.

Our goal is to make it easier for you to build a stable broadcasting/streaming service with sub-second latency.
