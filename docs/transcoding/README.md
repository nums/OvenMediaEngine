OvenMediaEngine supports Live Transcoding for Adaptive Bitrate(ABR) streaming and protocol compatibility.  Each protocol supports different codecs, and ABR needs to change resolution and bitrate in different ways.  Using **OutputProfile**, codecs, resolutions, and bitrates can be converted, and ABR can be configured as a variety of sets using a **Playlist**.

This document explains how to configure encoding settings, set up playlists.

### Transcoding

This section explains how to define output streams, change the codec, bitrate, resolution, frame rate, sample rate, and channels for video/audio, as well as how to use the bypass method.

### Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) Stream

This section explains how to use a Playlist to assemble ABR streams by selecting tracks encoded in various qualities.

### TranscodeWebhook

The transcoding webhook feature is used when dynamic changes to encoding and ABR configuration are needed based on the type or quality of the input stream.
